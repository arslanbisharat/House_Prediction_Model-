# House Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using various features. The project focuses on exploratory data analysis feature engineering predictive modeling and model evaluation. We will also incorporate MLOps tools for tracking experiments managing models and deploying the best-performing model.

## Folder Structure

- `configs/` - Contains configuration files such as hyperparameters for training the model
- `data/` - Includes the datasets used for training testing and validation
- `mlflow/` - Used for tracking experiments and managing model versions
- `models/` - Stores the trained models and their respective versions
- `scripts/` - Includes utility scripts for data preprocessing and feature engineering
- `src/` - Contains the main code for model training and evaluation
- `tests/` - Holds unit tests to ensure code quality and correctness

## Project Phases

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We will start by loading the dataset and performing data cleaning and visualization. This includes understanding relationships between features and the target variable house price. We will use Python libraries like pandas numpy matplotlib and seaborn for this phase.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
In this phase we will handle missing values normalize numerical data and encode categorical features. We will also explore feature selection methods to improve the performance of our model.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
We will begin with linear regression as our baseline model and gradually move to more advanced models like decision trees random forests and XGBoost. Each model will be evaluated using relevant metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
We will evaluate the model performance using cross-validation. Additionally we will tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV to optimize the model.

### 5. MLOps and MLflow Integration
We will integrate MLflow to track all experiments and manage different model versions. This will help in keeping a record of the best-performing models and will ease deployment.
